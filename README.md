## Compatibility
This SDK is compatible with **Python 3 and higher**.

## Getting started
Below is a simple example that describes the instantiation and most basic usage of our SDK:

Run `pip install splitio_client`


```python
from splitio import get_factory
from splitio.exceptions import TimeoutException
factory = get_factory('YOUR_SDK_TYPE_API_KEY', config=config)
try:
    factory.block_until_ready(5) # wait up to 5 seconds
    split = factory.client()
    treatment = split.get_treatment('CUSTOMER_ID', 'SPLIT_NAME')
    if treatment == "on":
        # insert code here to show on treatment
    elif treatment == "off":
        # insert code here to show off treatment
    else:
        # insert your control treatment code here
except TimeoutException:
    # Now the user can choose whether to abort the whole execution, or just keep going
    # without a ready client, which if configured properly, should become ready at some point.
    pass
```
